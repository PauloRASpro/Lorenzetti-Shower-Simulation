This folder contains split `.zip` files representing a compressed version of the original Lorenzetti simulation dataset.  
To access the full `.csv` file with the simulation data, please download **all parts** and extract them in sequence.  
Once extracted, they will reconstruct the original CSV containing normalized Ringer ring energies, cluster variables, and ground-truth calibration targets.
